# A list of domains to check when a client makes a request. They are
# checked in the oder listed. The domains listed must have a matching
# configuration section in the format [domain/domainname]

# The verbosity of output and logging related to PAM requests. Uncomment

cache_credentials = true
# This enables or disables credential caching. I.e. after successfully
# authenticating a user, the credentials will be stored locally. If the 
# domain is unavailable, users will still be able to login using the 
# cached information.

# By default, the credential cache never expires. If you want sssd to 
# remove cached credentials, this option will cause them to expire 
# after the number of days it is set to.

id_provider = ldap
# SSSD can resolve user information from a number of different sources
# such as LDAP, local files, and Active Directory. This option sets
# the domain's source of identity information.

# As with identity providers, SSSD can authenticate in a variety of ways.
# By default, SSSD will use the value of id_provider.

# The access provider controls the source for determining who is allowed
# to access the system. Even if a user successfully authenticates, if they
# don't meet the criteria provider by the access provider, they will be
# denied access.

ldap_access_filter = (objectClass=posixAccount)
# These define the criteria the access provider uses to control who
# is allowed to login. In this case, any user that matches the 
# LDAP filter in this example will be allowed access. Any entry
# that has an objectClass of posixAccount will be allowed access.

ldap_search_base = ${ARG_DOMAINCONTROLLER}
# The LDAP search base you want SSSD to use when looking
# for entries. There are options for search bases for various types
# of searches, such as users. Read the sssd-ldap man page for details.

# ldap_tls_cacert = /pki/cacerts.pem
# The file containing CA certificates you want sssd to trust.

# ldap_tls_cipher_suite = HIGH
# The TLS ciphers you wish to use. SSSD uses OpenSSL style cipher
# suites

ldap_default_bind_dn = ${ARG_BINDDN}
# The DN used to search your directory with. It must have read access to
# everything your system needs.

ldap_default_authtok = ${ARG_L_ADMINPASSWORD}
# The password of the bind DN.

ldap_tls_reqcert = demand
# This defines how sssd will handle server certificates. Demand means
# that we are requiring the host portion of the URI to match the
# certificate's subject or an SAN, the current time is within the valid
# times on the certificate, and that it's signing chain ends with a CA
# in the file defined by ldap_tls_cacert.
